# firstpasssolution

## Follows the lecture on March 18th, 2020.

The first part of the lecture went over good ways of solving quicksort and merge sort.

In the src, there are both of those functions that are properly working.

The second half of the lecture goes over First Pass Solutions, which refers to solving the problem maybe not in the most efficient way, but gets the job done, so then you may focus on a better solution.
